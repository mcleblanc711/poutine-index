      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The Poutine Index is inspired by <em>The Economist's</em> Big Mac Index, which uses the price of
        a Big Mac to compare purchasing power across countries. Similarly, we use classic poutine—a
        quintessentially Canadian dish—to compare food costs and affordability across Canadian cities.
      </p>

      <h2>What Qualifies as Classic Poutine?</h2>
      <p>
        For consistency, we only track prices for <strong>classic poutine</strong>, defined as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>French fries</li>
        <li>Fresh cheese curds</li>
        <li>Brown gravy</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We exclude "loaded" or topped poutines (e.g., with pulled pork, bacon, vegetables, or other additions)
        because their prices vary significantly based on toppings, making comparisons unreliable.
      </p>

      <h2>Size Normalization</h2>
      <p>
        Restaurants use inconsistent size names (e.g., "regular" vs. "medium" vs. "single"). We normalize
        all sizes into three categories:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Small:</strong> The smallest portion offered, typically 200-300g</li>
        <li><strong>Regular:</strong> The standard/medium portion, or the only size if just one is offered</li>
        <li><strong>Large:</strong> The largest portion, sometimes called "family" or "jumbo"</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When only one size is available, it is classified as "Regular" for comparison purposes.
      </p>

      <h2>Restaurant Selection Criteria</h2>
      <p>
        We focus on independent and local chain restaurants to get a representative sample of each city's
        poutine market. The following types of establishments are <strong>excluded</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>National fast food chains (McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, A&W, etc.)</li>
        <li>National poutine chains (Smoke's Poutinerie, New York Fries)</li>
        <li>Quick-service chains (Harvey's, Tim Hortons, Dairy Queen)</li>
        <li>Stadium, airport, or tourist-trap venues with inflated prices</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Restaurants are discovered using Google Places API with the search query "poutine restaurant" near
        each city's coordinates. We aim for approximately 10-15 data points per city.
      </p>

      <h2>The Affordability Index</h2>
      <p>
        The affordability index measures how many minutes of minimum wage work are required to purchase
        a regular-sized classic poutine in each city. The formula is:
      </p>
      <div class="formula">
        Affordability Index = (Regular Price / Provincial Minimum Wage) × 60
      </div>
      <p>
        For example, if a regular poutine costs $12.00 and the provincial minimum wage is $15.00/hour:
      </p>
      <div class="formula">
        ($12.00 / $15.00) × 60 = 48 minutes
      </div>
      <p>
        A higher affordability index means poutine is less affordable relative to local wages. This metric
        allows comparison between cities with different price levels and wage standards.
      </p>

      <h3>Minimum Wage Data</h3>
      <p>
        We use the general minimum wage for each province or territory (not special rates for specific
        industries or age groups). Minimum wage data is updated quarterly to reflect legislated changes.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Collection Process</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Restaurant Discovery:</strong> Google Places API identifies poutine-serving restaurants
          in each target city.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Price Extraction:</strong> Restaurant websites and online menus are reviewed to find
          classic poutine prices. Prices are extracted manually with LLM assistance.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Validation:</strong> Automated scripts check for outliers (prices more than 2 standard
          deviations from city mean), missing data, and stale information.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Aggregation:</strong> City-level statistics (mean, median, min, max) are calculated
          and combined with minimum wage data.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Confidence Levels</h2>
      <p>
        Each price data point is assigned a confidence level:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>High:</strong> Price clearly listed on official website or menu</li>
        <li><strong>Medium:</strong> Price inferred from menu (e.g., category pricing) or third-party source</li>
        <li><strong>Low:</strong> Estimated from similar items or older data; used only when necessary</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Update Frequency</h2>
      <p>
        We aim to update price data <strong>quarterly</strong>. Minimum wage data is updated whenever
        provincial/territorial governments announce changes. The "last updated" date on the map reflects
        the most recent data processing run.
      </p>

      <h2>Limitations and Caveats</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Sample size:</strong> Some smaller cities may have fewer data points, making averages
          less reliable.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Price volatility:</strong> Restaurant prices change frequently. Our data represents
          a snapshot in time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Online menu availability:</strong> Not all restaurants have online menus, potentially
          biasing the sample toward establishments with web presence.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Regional variations:</strong> Within large metropolitan areas (e.g., Toronto, Montreal),
          prices may vary significantly by neighbourhood.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Taxes not included:</strong> Prices shown are menu prices before applicable taxes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Delivery markups excluded:</strong> We use dine-in/pickup prices only.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Target Cities</h2>
      <p>
        Version 1 of the Poutine Index covers the top 20 Canadian Census Metropolitan Areas (CMAs) by
        population, plus four additional locations chosen for geographic coverage:
      </p>
      <ul>

        <li>Yellowknife, Northwest Territories</li>
        <li>Whitehorse, Yukon</li>
